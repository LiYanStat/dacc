Description: Conduct Regularized optimal fingerprinting via GLS and 
    generalized TLS for climate change detection. Point and interval estimator 
    for scaling factors under GLS and TLS. Provide shrinkage estimators from 
    Ledoit&Wolf 2004 <doi:10.1016/S0047-259X(03)00096-4> and 
    Ledoit&Wolf 2017 <doi:10.2139/ssrn.2383361>.
