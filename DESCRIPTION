Description: 
    Conduct detection and attribution of climate change using methods including optimal fingerprinting via 
    generalized total least squares or estimating equation approach from Ma et al. (2023) <doi:10.1175/JCLI-D-22-0681.1>. 
    Provide shrinkage estimators for covariance matrix from Ledoit and Wolf (2004) <doi:10.1016/S0047-259X(03)00096-4>, 
    and Ledoit and Wolf (2017) <doi:10.2139/ssrn.2383361>.
