Description: 
    Detection and attribution of climate change using methods including optimal fingerprinting via 
    generalized total least squares or an estimating equation approach (Li et al., 2025, 
    <doi:10.1175/JCLI-D-24-0193.1>; Ma et al., 2023, <doi:10.1175/JCLI-D-22-0681.1>).
    Provides shrinkage estimators for the covariance matrix following 
    Ledoit and Wolf (2004, <doi:10.1016/S0047-259X(03)00096-4>) and 
    Ledoit and Wolf (2017, <doi:10.2139/ssrn.2383361>).
